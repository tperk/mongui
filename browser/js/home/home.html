    <h1>Welcome to Mongui!</h1>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
	    <h3>Mongui is a single page application designed to easily create and export mongoose schemas.</h3>
	    <h2>Making Schemas:</h2>
	    <h3>To start, log in through facebook, github or google. Next create a project that you wish to work on.</h3>
	    <h3>After that, you can create and edit any number of schemas you want. Create a schema and give it a name like 'User.' Then add a field like 'First Name.' Then select any built in validation options you want on that field. You can also write functions for each schema such as virtuals or methods. Save the schema and you're all set!</h3>
	    <h2>Seeding:</h2>
	    <h3>Mongui can also generate random seed data for your project with just a few clicks. Once you have created your schemas, click the flower icon to go to the seed page for that schema. Input how many seed documents you want as well as the type of data such as 'first name' and then hit seed field. Your seed file will now be generated!</h3>
	    <h2>Download:</h2>
	    <h3>To download the schemas and seed file, head back to your projects page. There are two ways to download: Zip and NPM.</h3>
	    <h2>NPM:</h2>
	    <h3>If you click the NPM upload button, you will be provided with the name of the file on NPM to install. Copy and paste into your terminal and run the command inside of the project on your computer.</h3>
